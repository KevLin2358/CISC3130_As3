<p><b>Was the song ever a billboard top hit? When?</b></p> 
<p>This single reached the top 5 on record charts in 20 countries including France, Italy, Poland, Norway, Australia and New Zealand. In the US, it peaked a number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2014.</p>

<p><b>What were the top words found? Was it a surprise?</b></p> 
When I first heard this song, I believed that Chandelier would be the most recurring word, besides the usual predicates. I was suprised to find out that tonight was the most recurring. Chandelier only came up 8 times in the whole song. Usually, I believe that the most used words in a song is in the title. The song itself is basically repition. The beginning verse and mid verse are the only unique verse that does not repeat. The rest repeats twice and the final verse is just the same repition of the same words "On for tonight 'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight".</p>
